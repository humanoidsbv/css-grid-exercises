                    Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela Xhosa: 18 July 1918 – 5 December
                    2013) was a South African anti-apartheid activist who served
                    as the first president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He
                    was the country's first black head of state and the first
                    elected in a fully representative democratic election. His
                    government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by
                    fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African
                    nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the
                    African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.

                    Marilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926 –
                    August 4, 1962) was an American actress. Famous for playing
                    comedic "blonde bombshell" characters, she became one of the
                    most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s, as
                    well as an emblem of the era's sexual revolution. She was a
                    top-billed actress for a decade, and her films grossed $200
                    million (equivalent to $2 billion in 2021) by the time of
                    her death in 1962. Long after her death, Monroe remains a
                    major icon of pop culture. In 1999, the American Film
                    Institute ranked her sixth on their list of the greatest
                    female screen legends from the Golden Age of Hollywood.
                    Multiple film critics and media outlets have cited Monroe as
                    one of the best actors never to have received an Academy
                    Award nomination.

                    Robert Nesta Marley OM (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981;
                    baptised in 1980 as Berhane Selassie) was a Jamaican singer,
                    musician, and songwriter. Considered one of the pioneers of
                    reggae, his musical career was marked by fusing elements of
                    reggae, ska, and rocksteady, as well as his distinctive
                    vocal and songwriting style. Marley's contributions to music
                    increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide, and
                    made him a global figure in popular culture to this day.
                    Over the course of his career, Marley became known as a
                    Rastafari icon, and he infused his music with a sense of
                    spirituality. He is also considered a global symbol of
                    Jamaican music and culture and identity, and was
                    controversial in his outspoken support for democratic social
                    reforms. In 1976, Marley survived an assassination attempt
                    in his home, which was thought to be politically motivated.
                    He also supported legalization of marijuana, and advocated
                    for Pan-Africanism.

                    Marie Equi (April 7, 1872 – July 13, 1952) was an early
                    American medical doctor in the American West devoted to
                    providing care to working-class and poor patients. She
                    regularly provided birth control information and abortions
                    at a time when both were illegal. She became a political
                    activist and advocated civic and economic reforms, including
                    women's right to vote and an eight-hour workday. After being
                    clubbed by a policeman in a 1913 workers' strike, Equi
                    aligned herself with anarchists and the radical labor
